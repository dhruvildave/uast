Devanagari (IAST: _devanāgarī_) is the writing system that is adapted by various languages
like Sanskrit (IAST: _saṃskṛta_). International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is
a transliteration scheme for romanisation of Sanskrit language. IAST makes use of diacritics
to represent various characters. On a computer, these are represented using Unicode standard
which differs from how the Sanskrit language behaves at a very fundamental level. This
results in an issue that is encountered while designing typesetting software for _devanāgarī_
and IAST. We hereby discuss the problems and provide a solution that solves the issue of
incompatibilities between various transliteration and encoding schemes.
