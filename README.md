Devanāgarī is the writing system that is adapted by various languages like Saṃskṛta. International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a transliteration scheme for romanisation of Saṃskṛta language. IAST makes use of diacritics to represent various characters. On a computer, these are represented using Unicode standard which differs from how the Saṃskṛta language behaves at a very fundamental level. This results in an issue that is encountered while designing typesetting software for Devanāgarī and IAST. We hereby discuss the problems and provide a solution that solves the issue of incompatibilities between various transliteration and encoding schemes.
